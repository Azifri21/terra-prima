                <h2>Terra 1</h2>
                <p>An Earth-like planet home to around 5 billion people. Up to the year 1945, it shared a history similar to our Earth, from which it drifted apart after Erica Cero, the first known plane shifter, established contact with other parallel Earths. It is currently the main core world of the Terra Alliance and where most of its governmental institutions are located.</p>

                <h2>Terratex</h2>
                <p>A world that nearly underwent ecocide. The catastrophe was stopped by Carla Luna, who created nanoparticles that turned people into controllable puppets, stopping them from causing more harm to each other and the environment.</p>
                <p>Under Carla's control, this world underwent rapid technological development and at some point, its scientists discovered the multiverse and learned to travel it. Carla is currently on a quest to assimilate other human-inhabited worlds.</p>
                <p>Over time, Carla's approach to assimilation seems to have changed from a direct control into a milder, more indirect, behavioral guidance.</p>

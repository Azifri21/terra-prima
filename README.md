# terra-prima.github.io
A personal project to learn how to create a website, using my webcomic Terra Prima as the main topic.

Most of the JS was taken from Rarebit, an open-source webcomics template: https://rarebit.neocities.org/

The responsive grid on the "characters" page was adapted from Travis Horn's tutorial: https://travishorn.com/responsive-grid-in-2-minutes-with-css-grid-layout-4842a41420fe

    <p>Right... about the comic. <br>
        It's a sci-fi comic with some drama and musings about individuality, indentity, the value and impact of someone's actions, and other stuff typical of sci-fi.<br>
        The story places a lot of emphasis on the characters, I think that's called a slow burn story. Anyway, if any of that sounds interesting to you, please consider giving it a read :) <br>

            <h1>Terra Prima</h1>

            <p>Terra Prima is a science fiction comic that follows the journey of an idealistic scientist, a self-absorbed collector of emotions, and a mysterious madman, as well as the people they meet along the way, as they deal with their personal challenges amidst a multiverse-wide conflict.</p>

            <p>I started drawing this comic around 2010, as a practice comic since I had never drawn a long comic before, and the plan was to draw only Book One. As my drawing skills improved, I decided to continue the comic. This story was inspired by a game my friends and I created.</p>

            <p>You can also read the comic on <a href="https://tapas.io/series/Terra-Prima/info" title="a link to my webcomic Terra Prima" target="_blank">Tapas</a> </p>

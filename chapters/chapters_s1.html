    <h1>Season 1</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 1 - Claudia Luna</h2>
    <p>Biomedical scientist Claudia Luna publishes a groundbreaking finding: she and her team have created nanoparticles that can restore damaged and diseased tissues to their former healthy state. This produces great excitement in the scientific community and the public until evidence starts piling up that no other laboratory can replicate Claudia's work, and her research is quickly dismissed as a fraud.
        <br>
        While under internal investigation, Claudia receives an offer from a biotech company named Neogene, which seems to believe in the validity of her nanoparticle research. However, Claudia quickly realizes how questionable this company's procedures are and rejects any possibility of joining them. Neogene doesn't take Claudia's answer well and attempts to capture her. Claudia manages to evade them and goes into hiding, but as she is increasingly isolated and out of options, she flees the country.

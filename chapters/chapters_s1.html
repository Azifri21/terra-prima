    <h1>Season 1</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 1 - Claudia Luna</h2>
    <p>When biomedical scientist Claudia Luna publishes the results of her groundbreaking investigation on nanoparticle-mediated tissue regeneration, the excitement is short-lived when no other laboratory can replicate Claudia's work, and her research is quickly dismissed as a fraud. While under internal investigation, Claudia receives an offer from a biotech company named Neogene, who oddly enough seems to believe in the validity of her research. Could there be something else at play here?
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 2 - Desquicio</h2>  
    <p>Just as Desquicio thought there we no worthy emotions left to add to his collection, a mercenary named Roger arrives with the task to take him to Terra Obscura, a parallel Earth with a history completely different from Desquicio's reality. Could humanity developed under different circumstances possess emotions different from what Desquicio knows? Could it be worth the risk?
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 3 - The Madman</h2>  
    <p>The Madman only wants to have fun and find the way to a party he's supposed to get to, but his quest is interrupted when Roger arrives, also with instructions to take him to the parallel world of Terra Obscura. Could his party be somewhere else in the multiverse? Only one way to find out.
